# Audit reports

## About me
I am a software engineer with 9+ years of experience transitioning from web2 to web3. I started studying about blockchain security in 2023 and in Feb 2024 I started participating in audit contests on [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/) and [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/). Ever since, I have been working full-time as an independent smart contract security researcher.

I am currently seeking for opportunities in the web3 industry. My personal preferences are security (or development) of smart contracts and DeFi protocols with Solidity.

This repository is exclusively dedicated to my audit reports. You can find more about me (e.g. personal projects, studying progress tracking, writings and achievements) in my [full portfolio]().
